# personalwebsite

This site is not finish yet.

This project is based on the end-of-term project of my introduction to information systems lessons, but it is programing with Bottle. This time I use Flask and improve some important part. If I have a time, I will reboot the project and share link.

URL of the Heroku app:
https://ayberkbozkus.herokuapp.com/

This is a trial site. I used Python, Flask, HTML5 and CSS.
